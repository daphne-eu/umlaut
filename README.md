# End-to-end-ML-System-Benchmark
A modular suite for benchmarking all stages of Machine Learning pipelines. To find bottlenecks in such pipelines and compare different ML tools, this framework can calculate and visualize several metrics in the data preparation, model training, model validation and inference stages.


## Current metrics include:
* Time spent
* Memory usage
* Loss (single run and multiple runs)
* Time to Accuracy (single run and multiple runs)
* Power usage
* Multiclass Confusion Matrix
* Standard metrics as accuracy, F1, TP/TN etc.
* Latency
* Throughput
