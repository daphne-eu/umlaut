# End-to-end-ML-System-Benchmark
A modular suite for benchmarking all stages of Machine Learning pipelines. To find bottlenecks in such pipelines and compare different ML tools, this framework can calculate and visualize several metrics in the data preparation, model training, model validation and inference stages.
